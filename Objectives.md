## Prevention
How do you get people to follow the rules?

### Visibilty
#### For Parents and Students
* CAFR - For both Student and Campus activity funds, publish transaction summaries for all accounts and summed by school.
* FASRG - Fund disclosure statement on all fund raising materials.
* FASRG - Activity fund checking account register published publicy.  Similar to what is done with the District register.

### Awareness
#### For Sponsors and Administrators
* Have sponsors sign acknowledgement of liability and current balance in fund.
* Have principals and designees sign acknowledgment of liability and current balances in funds.

### Clarifications
* Student Led Business Organization (SLBO).
* "skin-in-the-game".

### Simplification
* SLBO audit checklist
* SLBO document templates
* Activity fund audit checklist

### Adjustments
* Reclassification of student activity funds without a SLBO to campus activity funds. 
* NEISD - Reinstatment of campus activity fund excessive accumulation limits.
* NEISD Travel Accounting System - Upgrade of system to automatically prevent GSA per diem limits--Requires entry of individual meals.
