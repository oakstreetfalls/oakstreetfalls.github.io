## Prevention

### Greater Visibilty
#### For Parents and Students
* CAFR - For both Student and Campus activity funds, publish transaction summaries for all accounts and summed by school.
* FASRG - Fund disclosure statement on all fund raising materials.
* FASRG - Activity fund checking account register published publicy.  Similar to what is done with the District register.

#### For Sponsors and Administrators
* Increase awareness of sponsors liability--require sponsor to sign acknowledgement of liability and current balance in fund.
* Increase awareness of principals and designees liability -- sign acknowledgment of liability and current balances in funds.

### Clarifications
* Of a Student Activity Organization (SAO) with an audit checklist.
* Clarification of when the District can require payments from students to participate in activities, e.g. "skin-in-the-game".

### Adjustments
* Reclassification of student funds without a SAO to campus funds. 
* NEISD - Reinstatment of campus activity fund excessive accumulation limits.
* NEISD Travel Accounting System - Upgrade of system to automatically prevent GSA per diem limits--Requires entry of individual meals.
* Activity fund audit checklist.
