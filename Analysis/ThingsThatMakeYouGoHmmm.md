### Contracts

Why did Mr. Bonham approve a proposal where Form 1925 is blatantly false.
* "Controlling Parter, North East ISD" [Form 1925]

### Internal Audit
3/20/2018

Why wasn't there a deeper and/or broader investigation? 
> SCOPE   
The scope of this review is narrow. The review only focuses on the purchasing initiated by Ms.
Christina Moreno with the company allegedly owned by her son, UMP. 
* SCOPE [SUBJECT: Review of ETA Rocket Club Expenditures](https://oakstreetfalls.github.io/Analysis/2018-03-20%20MMO%20Mitchell%20Review%20of%20ETA%20Rocket%20Club%20Expenditures.pdf#page=12)

Why was everyone who received a copy of Dr. Mitchel's report OK with not pressing charges?  
>CLOSING COMMENTS

staff throughout this review.

### Follow Up Case Report
7/16/2018

Why did NEISD consider 85% of an estimated loss that was from a limited investigation as "being made whole"? $18,907 / $16,054 = 85%.

>The North East ISD Internal Audit Director, Anthony Mitchell estimated the total loss to NEISD at
$18,907.00. 

* "$18,907.00" [Page 2](https://oakstreetfalls.github.io/Analysis/2018-03-22%20RPT%20Dominguez%20Follow%20Up%20Case%2018-01155.pdf#page=2)

>NEISD Human Resources  
NEISD Human Resources Employee Relations Officer Michael Wiley provided me a copy of an
email he submitted to the Texas Education Agency's Investigator Mario Ramirez. The email states
that Moreno made the district whole by accepting the terms of her resignation which was effective
04/17/2018. The terms included that Moreno would not be paid out the remainder of her contract
for this school year which was 43 days. The remainder of her salary, and what the district would have had to pay out for her medical insurance equalled $16,054.07.

* "$16,054.07" [Page 6](https://oakstreetfalls.github.io/Analysis/2018-03-22%20RPT%20Dominguez%20Follow%20Up%20Case%2018-01155.pdf#page=6)

Why didn't NEISD really press charges? Isn't this just another form of "Passing the Trash"?
> Conclusion  
Based on the information obtained during this investigation Moreno would have been charges with
P.C. 32.46 Securing Execution of Document By Deception with the pecuniary interest being
between $2,500 and $30,000; a State Jail Felony. Due to the district making a payment
arrangement with the Moreno, this case is now a civil matter and no charges can be filed.
* [Conclusion](https://oakstreetfalls.github.io/Analysis/2018-03-22%20RPT%20Dominguez%20Follow%20Up%20Case%2018-01155.pdf#page=7)

Did NEISD violate a bankruptcy court order when they took Ms. Moreno's summer paychecks?
* "IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, that no deductions for account of any garnishment, wage assignment, credit union or other purpose
not specifically authorized by this Court be made from the earnings of the debtor."

### NEISD Board Meeting

dollars and seventy-seven cents ($12,235.77) to the ETA Rocketry Club.
ADOPTED this 13th day of January 2020, by the Board of Trustees"
