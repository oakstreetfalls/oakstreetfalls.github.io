### Student Launch

Is the NEISD travel expense system really 15 years old, or has the copyright date just not been updated?
* "Copyright(c) 2005 North East Independent School District."

6/23/2017

Why did Joshua purchase tickets for Mr. Lozano using Joshua's address? It qualifies the purchase for a Florida resident discount, but "To pick up your ticket(s) ... a valid Florida photo ID for any Florida Resident products purchased ..."
* "Billing Information, Robert Lozano, 212 Integra Shores Dr, Suite 203, Daytona Beach, FL" [Subject: Your Ticket Order Confirmation](https://oakstreetfalls.github.io/Evidence/Email/UMP/TSA/messages/Attachments-1/receipt.pdf)

10/5/2017

Why did Mrs. Gentry and Mr. Lozano both not follow step 2? 
>"For all other equipment, attach a repair/service quote from the vendor.  Vendors must be either on the Vendor Bid List or a Purchasing Cooperative.  These can be found on the Procurement & ecommerce intranet website at http://intranet.int.neisd.net/purc/purchasing_tips.html"

10/13/17

Doesn't this show intential continuation of the fraud? 
* "You need to have quotes from vendors that are on bid." and then "We need to get you on the BID list!" [Subject: FW: ATTACHED: Repair Request
](https://oakstreetfalls.github.io/Evidence/Email/UMP/Misdirected%20POs/messages/20171013-FW_%20ATTACHED_%20Repair%20Request-10.html)

11//17
Why does Un Manned Propulsion submit a response for propsoal that isn't rocketry parts and supplies?  Could it be that it was the only proposal at that time?
* [RFP Response]

Why did Mr. Bonham approve the proposal when Form 1925 is blatantly false.
* "Controlling Parter, North East ISD" [Form 1925]

### Investigation

4/17/2018

Why wasn't there a deeper and/or broader investigation? 
 


Why did NEISD consider receiving 85% of the a loss that was from a limited investigation as "being made whole"?

[Follow Up Case Report-pg 6: NEISD Human Resource](https://oakstreetfalls.github.io/Analysis/2018-03-22%20RPT%20Dominguez%20Follow%20Up%20Case%2018-01155.pdf#page=6)
Estimated total loss of $18,907.00.  Only $16,054.07 (85%) recovered.  Most came from "summer paychecks" 

Why didn't NEISD press charges? Really.

Did NEISD violate the bankruptcy court order when they withheld Ms. Moreno "summer paychecks" as restitution for the theft?
* "IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, that no deductions for account of any garnishment, wage assignment, credit union or other purpose
not specifically authorized by this Court be made from the earnings of the debtor."
[Order to Employer, dtd 9/1/2017](https://oakstreetfalls.github.io/Evidence/Bankruptcy/17-%20180122884920%20Order%20to%20Employer%201000%20USD%20per%20month%202017-09-01-hmmm.pdf)


Why wasn't the money returned to the rocketry club in April of 2018 when the district took it from Ms. Moreno?
