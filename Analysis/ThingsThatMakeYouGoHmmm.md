### Student Launch

### POs
6/28/2017

Isn't this wire fraund? "They are a one stop shop.  No need to go to different vendors..."
[Subject: Adam Taylor Unmanned Propulsion & Educational supplies](https://oakstreetfalls.github.io/Evidence/Email/UMP/Misdirected%20POs/messages/20170628-Adam%20Taylor%20Unmanned%20Propulsion%20%26%20Educational%20supplies-3.html)

10/5/2017
Why did Mrs. Gentry and Mr. Lozano both not follow step 2? "For all other equipment, attach a repair/service quote from the vendor.  Vendors must be either on the Vendor Bid List or a Purchasing Cooperative.  These can be found on the Procurement & ecommerce intranet website at http://intranet.int.neisd.net/purc/purchasing_tips.html" [Equipment Repair/Service Request](https://oakstreetfalls.github.io/Evidence/Email/UMP/Misdirected%20POs/messages/Attachments-8/Repair%20HP%20Design%20jet%20T1300.pdf)

10/13/17
Doesn't this show intential continuation of the fraud? After being stopped for not being a proper vendor, "You need to have quotes from vendors that are on bid." Mrs. Moreno instructs Joshua: "We need to get you on the BID list!" [Subject: FW: ATTACHED: Repair Request

Un Manned Propulsion then submits a response to a currently open bid, even though it's not a bid for rocketry parts and supplies.
[RFP Response]
And NEISD approves the bid even though Form 1925 is blatantly false.

Estimated total loss of $18,907.00.  Only $16,054.07 (85%) recovered.  Most came from "summer paychecks" yet there was an order from the bankruptcy court that "IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, that no deductions for account of any garnishment, wage assignment, credit union or other purpose
not specifically authorized by this Court be made from the earnings of the debtor."
