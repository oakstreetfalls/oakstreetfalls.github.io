### Un Manned Propulsion Corp - Inception
7/26/2016

Why, the day after returning from PLTW training in Daytona, FL, would you pay so much for a new car?  Could it be because you, your son and his friends had just come up with an embezzlement scheme?

### Student Launch

Isn't this making false statements to an agency of the federal government?

Why are the drone parts missing when they were paid for nearly six months prior? Have these drones ever flown? Is this a complete loss?

### POs

Isn't this wire fraund?

Doesn't this show deliberate continuation of the fraud?

Why did Un Manned Propulsion submit a response for a propsoal that isn't rocketry parts and supplies?  Could it be that it was the only request open at that time?

Why did Mr. Bonham approve a proposal where Form 1925 is blatantly false.
* "Controlling Parter, North East ISD" [Form 1925]

### Investigation

11//17

Why didn't Mr. Lozano report the suspicions about embezzlement to Dr. Mitchell? 

Why didn't Mr. Bohomn look deeper instead of just consulting the bid vendor list?

If Joshua Moreno could donate $700 to a scholarship then why couldn't he be asked to repay the stolen money?
