### Un Manned Propulsion Corp - Inception
7/26/2016

Why, the day after returning from PLTW training in Daytona, FL, would you pay so much for a new car?  Could it be because you, your son and his friends had just come up with an embezzlement scheme?

* $31,220.50 @ 18.00% for 6 1/4 years = $778.57 / month [2016 Dodge Charger Sales Contract, page 5](https://oakstreetfalls.github.io/Evidence/Bankruptcy/17-%20180122954740%20Dodge%20Charger%20a%20Finance%20Contract%202016-07-26-hmmm.pdf#page=5)

### Student Launch
3/15/2017

Isn't this making false statements to an agency of the federal government? 
* "Joshua with Unmanned Propulsion has helped us a great deal with mentoring & video chat and funding all our supplies."

### Apparel
4/5/2017

Why would someone be reaching out to Mrs. Gentry regarding shirts purchased by Joshua Moreno of Un Manned Propulsion?  How involved was Mrs. Gentry?
* "I'm trying to get hold of Joshua"

### Watcher Drone

Why is Christina using ETA's 3-D printers to print drone pieces for Joshua before the drone PO was created?

Why are the drone parts missing when they were paid for nearly six months prior? Have these drones ever flown? Is this a complete loss?

### TSA Nationals - Orlando, FL
6/22-23/2017

Why were Mrs. Gentry and Ms. Moreno allowed to exceed per diem? GSA M&IE per diem for Orlanda, FL was $59.  Supper alone on 6/22 at Boston Lobster Feast was $53.20.

Is the NEISD travel expense system really 15 years old? or has the copyright date just not been updated?
* "Copyright(c) 2005 North East Independent School District."

6/23/2017

Why did Joshua purchase tickets for Mr. Lozano using Joshua's address? It qualifies the purchase for a Florida resident discount, but "To pick up your ticket(s) ... a valid Florida photo ID for any Florida Resident products purchased ..."  Did this really work?  Didn't Mr. Lozano just approve buying an overpriced laptop from Joshua's company?

Why did Mrs. Gentry and Mr. Lozano both not follow step 2?  How much were they involved? 
>"2.  For all other equipment, attach a repair/service quote from the vendor.  Vendors must be either on the Vendor Bid List or a Purchasing Cooperative.  These can be found on the Procurement & ecommerce intranet website at http://intranet.int.neisd.net/purc/purchasing_tips.html"

Doesn't this show deliberate continuation of the fraud?

Why did Un Manned Propulsion submit a response for a propsoal that isn't rocketry parts and supplies?  Could it be that it was the only request open at that time?

### Investigation

11//17

Why didn't Mr. Lozano report the suspicions about embezzlement to Dr. Mitchell? 

Why didn't Mr. Bohomn look deeper instead of just consulting the bid vendor list?

[Taking down the site]

Why are you warning Joshua?
[Don't reply, just read]

So, how did you meet Adam Taylor?

### Internal Audit
3/20/2018

Why wasn't there a deeper and/or broader investigation? 
> SCOPE   
The scope of this review is narrow. The review only focuses on the purchasing initiated by Ms.
Christina Moreno with the company allegedly owned by her son, UMP. 
* SCOPE [SUBJECT: Review of ETA Rocket Club Expenditures](https://oakstreetfalls.github.io/Analysis/2018-03-20%20MMO%20Mitchell%20Review%20of%20ETA%20Rocket%20Club%20Expenditures.pdf#page=12)

Why was everyone who received a copy of Dr. Mitchel's report OK with not pressing charges?  
>CLOSING COMMENTS  
Internal Audit is appreciative of the cooperation provided by the ETA campus administration and  
staff throughout this review.  
c: Dr. Brian G. Gottardy, Superintendent North East ISO   
   Mr. Wallace McCampbell, Chief of Police, NEISD

### Follow Up Case Report
7/16/2018

Why did NEISD consider 85% of an estimated loss that was from a limited investigation as "being made whole"? $18,907 / $16,054 = 85%.

>The North East ISD Internal Audit Director, Anthony Mitchell estimated the total loss to NEISD at
$18,907.00. 

* "$18,907.00" [Page 2](https://oakstreetfalls.github.io/Analysis/2018-03-22%20RPT%20Dominguez%20Follow%20Up%20Case%2018-01155.pdf#page=2)

>NEISD Human Resources  
NEISD Human Resources Employee Relations Officer Michael Wiley provided me a copy of an
email he submitted to the Texas Education Agency's Investigator Mario Ramirez. The email states
that Moreno made the district whole by accepting the terms of her resignation which was effective
04/17/2018. The terms included that Moreno would not be paid out the remainder of her contract
for this school year which was 43 days. The remainder of her salary, and what the district would have had to pay out for her medical insurance equalled $16,054.07.

* "$16,054.07" [Page 6](https://oakstreetfalls.github.io/Analysis/2018-03-22%20RPT%20Dominguez%20Follow%20Up%20Case%2018-01155.pdf#page=6)

Why didn't NEISD really press charges? Isn't this just another form of "Passing the Trash"?
> Conclusion  
Based on the information obtained during this investigation Moreno would have been charges with
P.C. 32.46 Securing Execution of Document By Deception with the pecuniary interest being
between $2,500 and $30,000; a State Jail Felony. Due to the district making a payment
arrangement with the Moreno, this case is now a civil matter and no charges can be filed.
* [Conclusion](https://oakstreetfalls.github.io/Analysis/2018-03-22%20RPT%20Dominguez%20Follow%20Up%20Case%2018-01155.pdf#page=7)

Did NEISD violate a bankruptcy court order when they took Ms. Moreno's summer paychecks?
* "IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, that no deductions for account of any garnishment, wage assignment, credit union or other purpose
not specifically authorized by this Court be made from the earnings of the debtor."

### ETA Awards Night
5/22/2019

If Joshua Moreno could donate $700 to a scholarship then why couldn't he be asked to repay the stolen money?
* [Facebook posts]

### ETA Potluck
9//2019

Why would Mrs. Gentry make the statements,"It was an unfortunate incident", "...need to move on.", and "We lost a good teacher when Ms. Moreno left."  Again, just how invovled was Mrs. Gentry?  They had co-sponsored TSA for several years.  They had shared fundraisers.  One of the coolers for the paletas was installed in Mrs. Gentry's room.

### NEISD Board Meeting
1/13/2020

Why wasn't the money returned to the rocketry club back in 2018 when the district first took it from Ms. Moreno?
> "to restore the amount of twelve thousand, two hundred thirty-five
dollars and seventy-seven cents ($12,235.77) to the ETA Rocketry Club.
ADOPTED this 13th day of January 2020, by the Board of Trustees"
