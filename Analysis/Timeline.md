### Student Launch
3/15/2017

Isn't this making "false statements" to an agency of the federal government? 
* "Joshua with Unmanned Propulsion has helped us a great deal with mentoring & video chat and funding all our supplies." [Subject: Re: **IMPORTANT DOCUMENT REQUEST**FW: STUDENT LAUNCH IMPORTANT INFORMATION](https://oakstreetfalls.github.io/Evidence/Email/UMP/Mentor/messages/20170315-Re___IMPORTANT%20DOCUMENT%20REQUEST__FW_%20STUDENT%20LAUNCH%20IMPORTANT%20INFORMATION-12.html)

### Apparel
4/5/2017

Why would someone be reaching out to Mrs. Gentry regarding shirts purchased by Joshua Moreno of Un Manned Propulsion? 
* "I'm trying to get hold of Joshua"

### Watcher Drone
5/31/2017

Why are the drone parts missing in May when they were paid for nearly six months prior? 
* "They are asking me for the drone parts. Camera etc.."
[Subject: Drone](https://oakstreetfalls.github.io/Evidence/Email/UMP/Watcher%20Drone/messages/20170531-Drone-15.html)
* "UN MANNED PROPULSION CORP      $3,690.00

### TSA Nationals - Orlando, FL
6/22-23/2017



6/23/2017

Why did Joshua purchase tickets for Mr. Lozano using Joshua's address? It qualifies the purchase for a Florida resident discount, but "To pick up your ticket(s) ... a valid Florida photo ID for any Florida Resident products purchased ..."
* "Billing Information, Robert Lozano, 212 Integra Shores Dr, Suite 203, Daytona Beach, FL" [Subject: Your Ticket Order Confirmation](https://oakstreetfalls.github.io/Evidence/Email/UMP/TSA/messages/Attachments-1/receipt.pdf)

### POs
6/28/2017

Isn't this wire fraund? 
* "This is why I send them my business."
[Subject: Adam Taylor Unmanned Propulsion & Educational supplies](https://oakstreetfalls.github.io/Evidence/Email/UMP/Misdirected%20POs/messages/20170628-Adam%20Taylor%20Unmanned%20Propulsion%20%26%20Educational%20supplies-3.html)

10/5/2017

Why did Mrs. Gentry and Mr. Lozano both not follow step 2? 
>"2.  For all other equipment, attach a repair/service quote from the vendor.  Vendors must be either on the Vendor Bid List or a Purchasing Cooperative.  These can be found on the Procurement & ecommerce intranet website at http://intranet.int.neisd.net/purc/purchasing_tips.html"
* [Equipment Repair/Service Request](https://oakstreetfalls.github.io/Evidence/Email/UMP/Misdirected%20POs/messages/Attachments-8/Repair%20HP%20Design%20jet%20T1300.pdf)
* "Johnny asked me to return this request to you.  You need to have quotes from vendors that are on bid."[See email sent Friday, October 6, 2017 2:46 PM, Subject: FW: ATTACHED: Repair Request
](https://oakstreetfalls.github.io/Evidence/Email/UMP/Misdirected%20POs/messages/20171013-FW_%20ATTACHED_%20Repair%20Request-10.html)

10/13/17

Doesn't this show deliberate continuation and concealment of the fraud? 
* "For your eyes only!! We need to get you on the BID list!" [See mail Date: 10/13/17, 11:15 AM, Subject: FW: ATTACHED: Repair Request
](https://oakstreetfalls.github.io/Evidence/Email/UMP/Misdirected%20POs/messages/20171013-FW_%20ATTACHED_%20Repair%20Request-10.html)

11//17

Why did Un Manned Propulsion submit a response for propsoal that isn't rocketry parts and supplies?  Could it be that it was the only request open at that time?
* RFP 17-xxx Software and Software contractors [RFP Response]

11//17

Why did Mr. Bonham approve a proposal where Form 1925 is blatantly false.
* "Controlling Parter, North East ISD" [Form 1925]

### Investigation

11//17

Why were the parts list different?

Why were parts being shipped from Joshua?

Why didn't Mr. Lozano report the suspicions about embezzlement to Dr. Mitchell? 

Why didn't Mr. Bohomn look deeper instead of just consulting the bid vendor list?
