# Activity Fund Disclosure Statement
This is a proposal for a state law that would require any request for money by a school to include a statement
that clearly identifies to whom the money is going, and where to get more information if interested.  

> This request for funds, 015-408-2021-18, is valid 7/1/2021-6/31/2022.  All money collected
> becomes the property of North East ISD.  For more information on school activity funds please click here.


> This request for funds, 015-002-2021-89, is valid 10/10/2020-12/31/2020.  All money collected
> becomes the property of the Roosevelt High School Rocketry Club.  For more information on school activity funds please click here.

Besides including the statement on fund raising materials, the only additional effort this law would place on schools is the addition 
of one static web page that explains how to make open record requests.

# Sample Activity Fund Disclosure Page

All funds collected by schools in the state of Texas are accounted for in Activity Funds.  The fund records are public records
and anyone can request them through an open records request.  These records include Sales Accountablity Sheets, Transaction Lists,
Check Requests, Receipts, Invoices, Authorizations, etc.
